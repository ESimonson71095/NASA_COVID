<i> Biodiversity in National Parks</i> is an app that let you visualize [Kaggle's biodiversity dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity).

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the maps, data and charts concerning the US National Parks and their resident species.

It has been made with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and you may find the code on [github](https://github.com/abenedetti/bioNPS/) and [rcloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/246130).
