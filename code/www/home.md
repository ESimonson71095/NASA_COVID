# About Using Fire TrendR 
<br><br>
### <i> Fire TrendR</i> is an app that lets you interactively plot [NASA's MODIS and VIIRS Active Fire datasets](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms).
<br>
### From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access data and charts that display fire trends across the United States
<br>
### Relavent Datasets Include:

* VIIRS Active Fire - With the increased resolution of the VIIRS sensor, this product provides a greater detection response over fires of relatively small areas

* MODIS Active Fire - With an archive that goes back to 2000, this product provides one of the longest records of fire history across the US 

* MODIS Burned Area - Post fire products like the MCD64A1 offer additional insights into fire history and can be used to validate active fire records

### This application was made with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and the application was adopted from R code on [github](https://github.com/abenedetti/bioNPS/).
