## Welcome !
<br><br>
<i> Fire Trendr</i> is an app that lets you interactively plot [NASA's MODIS and VIIRS Active Fire datasets](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms).

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access data and charts that display fire trends across the United States

It has been made with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and the application was adopted from R code on [github](https://github.com/abenedetti/bioNPS/). 

For a detailed walkthrough of NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) have a look at the video below.
