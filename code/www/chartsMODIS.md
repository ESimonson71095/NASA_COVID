### MODIS Time Series Figures

In this section you can view a couple of charts that display <a href='https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/c6-mcd14dl' target='_blank'>MODIS Active Fire</a> pixel counts by state over time. 

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies / Fire locations represent the center of a 1km pixel that is flagged by the MODIS MOD14/MYD14 Fire and Thermal Anomalies algorithm (Giglio 2003) as containing one or more fires within the pixel.
