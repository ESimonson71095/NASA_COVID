### VIIRS Time Series Figures

In this section you can view a couple of charts that display [VIIRS Active Fire](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-active-fire-data) pixel counts by state over time. 

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m thermal anomalies / active fire product provides data from the VIIRS sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The 375 m data complements Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters
